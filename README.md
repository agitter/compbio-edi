# EDI Considerations in Computational Biology PhD Programs and Societies

My goal with this repository is to curate the publicly stated steps that programs focused on computational biology are taking to enhance equity, diversity, and inclusion and links to seminar schedules and other potentially related elements.
Curations are included as csv files in the `data/` directory.
These are based on best efforts to examine websites associated with the program and are likely to be incomplete.
Please feel free to improve everything abut this effort by filing pull requests or providing information in issues.

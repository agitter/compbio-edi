# EDI Considerations in Computational Biology PhD Programs and Societies

My goal with this repository is to curate the publicly stated steps that programs and societies that include computational biology are taking to enhance equity, diversity, and inclusion and links to other elements of the graduate experience that might affect these.
I included scientific societies and PhD programs as these are entities that students are likely to encounter during graduate training.
Curations are included as json files in the `data/` directory.
These are based on best efforts to examine websites associated with the program and are likely to be incomplete.
Please feel free to improve everything abut this effort by filing pull requests or providing information in issues.
